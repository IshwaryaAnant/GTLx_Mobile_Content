        <h2>Problem 1</h2>

        <p>Consider the same block on the flat surface.  We apply a force of 7N, F1, to the block.  From the previous problem, we know that 7N is enough to overcome the static friction and get the block moving towards the right.  We continue to apply this force, F1 = 7N, on the block to keep the block moving.  How much force in the opposite direction, F2, is required to stop the block’s acceleration?  As in the previous problem, coefficient of static friction is 0.34 and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.25.
            INSERT IMAGE BELOW !!!</p>

        <p><b>Answer: 2.1N</b> <br> Observe the free body diagram drawn below. Notice that the force of friction opposing the block’s motion is now kinetic, thus the frictional force is given by the expression Fkf = μkFN = 4.9 N. The net force on the block before F2 is applied is then equal to F1 - Fkf = 2.1 N (to the right). Thus, we must apply a force F2 = 2.1 N to the left in order to bring the net force on the block to zero. In the absence of a net force, the block will begin moving at a constant velocity.</p>
