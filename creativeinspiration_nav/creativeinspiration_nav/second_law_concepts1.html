        <h2>Motion vs. Change in Motion</h2>

        <p>Newton's 2nd Law does not state what is required for something to be in motion. (The origin of an object's motion depends on the forces it experienced in the past.) The 2nd Law specifically quantifies the <i>rate of change</i> of motion (acceleration) any object will undergo as a consequence of the net force from all of the forces acting on it. </p>

        <br>
        <p>Because the law is describing changes in translational motion,</p>

        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li class="bullets">any deviation of the object's path from a straight line occurs because of some net force;</li>
            <li class="bullets">any change in speed also occurs because of some net force.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>Both of these phenomena imply acceleration, but the actual size of the acceleration depends on internal properties of the object and the external interactions imposed upon it. To move means that the position changes as time passes. Both velocity and acceleration characterize the motion; but they describe two very different aspects of motion.</p>
